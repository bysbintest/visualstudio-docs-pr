# Install a preview release

::: zone pivot="vsmac2019"

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio 2019 for Mac preview is now available. For the first time, it is available to install side-by-side with the latest stable release of Visual Studio for Mac.

## Requirements for the Visual Studio 2019 for Mac preview

* A Mac with macOS High Sierra 10.13 or above.

To build Xamarin apps for iOS or macOS, you'll also need:

* Xcode 10.0 or above. The latest stable version is usually recommended.
* An Apple ID. If you don't have an Apple ID already you can create a new one at https://appleid.apple.com. It's necessary to have an Apple ID for installing and signing into Xcode.

## Installing the preview

1. Download the preview installer from the [Visual Studio for Mac preview page](https://aka.ms/vs4mac-preview).
2. Once the download is complete, click the **VisualStudioforMacPreviewInstaller.dmg** to mount the installer, then run it by double-clicking the arrow logo:

## Install an update for Visual Studio 2017 for Mac

Before a new version of Visual Studio for Mac is officially released, it's available as a preview. The preview release gives you a chance to try out new features and get the latest bug fixes before they are fully incorporated into the product.

Preview releases to Visual Studio for Mac are distributed as an update, rather than through a separate download. Visual Studio for Mac has three updater channels, as described in the [update](update.md) article: Stable, Beta, and Alpha.

Most preview releases will be available through both the **Beta** and **Alpha** channels, but always check the [Preview Release Notes](/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-preview-relnotes) for the most accurate information.

To install the preview of Visual Studio for Mac, use the following steps:

1. Go to **Visual Studio > Check for Updates**.
2. In the Update channel combo box, select **Beta**.
3. Select the **Switch channel** button to switch to the selected channel and start downloading any new updates.
4. Select the **Restart and Install Updates** button to start installing the updates.

For more information on updating in Visual Studio for Mac, see the [update](update.md) article.
