So far we've run our application's code as if we were the only developer working on the app. In this section, we'll learn how Connected Environment streamlines team development:
* Enable a team of developers to work in the same development environment.
* Supports each developer iterating on their code in isolation and without fear of breaking others.
* Test code end-to-end, prior to code commit, without having to create mocks or simulate dependencies.

## Challenges with developing microservices
Our sample application isn't very complex at the moment. But in real-world development, challenges soon emerge as more services are added and the development team grows.

Picture yourself working on a service that interacts with dozens of other services.

1. It can become unrealistic to run everything locally for development. Your dev machine may not have enough resources to run the entire app. Or, perhaps your app has endpoints that need to be publicly reachable (for example, your app responds to a webhook from a SaaS app).
1. You can try to only run the services that you depend on, but this means you'd need know the full closure of dependencies (for example, dependencies of dependencies). Or, it's a matter of not easily knowing how to build and run your dependencies because you didn't work on them.
1. Some developers resort to simulating, or mocking up, many of their service dependencies. This can help sometimes, but managing those mocks can soon take on its own development effort. Plus, this leads to your dev environment looking very different to production, and subtle bugs can creep in.
1. It follows that doing any type of end-to-end testing becomes difficult. Integration testing can only realistically happen post-commit, which means we see problems later in the development cycle.

## Work in a shared development environment
With Connected Environment, you can set up a *shared* development environment in Azure. Each developer can focus on just their part of the application, and can iteratively develop *pre-commit code* in an environment that already contains all the other services and cloud resources that their scenarios depend on. Dependencies are always up to date, and developers are working in a way that mirrors production.

## Work in your own space
As you develop code for your service, and before you're ready to check it in, code often won't be in a good state. You're still iteratively shaping it, testing it, and experimenting with solutions. Connected Environment provides the concept of a **space**, which allows you to work in isolation, and without the fear of breaking your team members.

> [!Note]
> Before you proceed, close all VS Code windows for both services, and then run `vsce up -d` in each of the service's root folders. (This is a Preview limitation.)

Let's take a closer look at where the services are currently running. Run the `vsce list` command, and you'll see output similar to the following:

```
Name         Space     Chart              Ports   Updated     Access Points
-----------  --------  -----------------  ------  ----------  -------------------------
mywebapi     mainline  mywebapi-0.1.0     80/TCP  2m ago     <not attached>
webfrontend  mainline  webfrontend-0.1.0  80/TCP  1m ago     https://webfrontend-contosodev.vsce.io
```

The Space column shows that both services are running in a space named `mainline`. Anyone who opens the public URL and navigates to the web app will invoke the code path we previously wrote that runs through both services. Now suppose we want to continue developing `mywebapi`. How can we do this and not interrupt other developers who are using the dev environment? To do that, we'll set up our own space.

## Create a space
To run our own version of `mywebapi` in a space other than `mainline`, we create our own space:
``` 
vsce space create --name scott
```

In the example above, I've used my name for the new space so that it is identifiable to my peers that that's the space I'm working in, but you can call it anything you'd like and be flexible about what it means, like 'sprint4' or 'demo'. 

Run the `vsce space list` command to see a list of all the spaces in the dev environment. An asterisk (*) appears next to the currently selected space. In our case, the space named 'scott' was automatically selected when it was created. You can select another space at any time with the `vsce space select` command.
