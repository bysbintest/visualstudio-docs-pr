# Legacy Designer for Windows Workflow Foundation UI Help
This section contains the context-sensitive Help topics for the legacy Windows Workflow Designer in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)]. Use the legacy designer when you need to target the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].

 You can access these topics from the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../misc/includes/vs_current_long_md.md)] user interface by pressing **F1** when a legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] dialog box is open.
