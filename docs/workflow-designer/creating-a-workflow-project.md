# Creating a Workflow Project

Workflows, [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../workflow-designer/includes/indigo1_md.md)] workflow services, custom activities, and custom activity designers can be created using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project templates. This section describes how to create libraries and applications with the project templates available in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

The first four topics below describe how to use of the Workflow Templates found on the **New Project** window. These templates can be accessed by opening [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)] and selecting **File** -> **New** -> **Project...**, then the **Workflow** category from the **Installed Templates** section on the left, under either the **Visual Basic** or **Visual C#** node.

The last topic describes how to add workflow activities, designers and services or other [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] items to an existing workflow (or other) project.
