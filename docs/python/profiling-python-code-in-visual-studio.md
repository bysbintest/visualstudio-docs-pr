# Profiling Python code

You can profile a Python application when using CPython-based interpreters. (See [Features matrix - profiling](overview-of-python-tools-for-visual-studio.md#matrix-profiling) for the availability of this feature for different versions of Visual Studio.)

Profiling is started through the **Analyze > Launch Python Profiling** menu command, which opens a configuration dialog:

When you select **OK**, the profiler runs and opens a performance report through which you can explore how time is spent in the application:

For a demonstration, see the video [Profiling Python](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/python-tools-for-visual-studio-2017-18121?l=s6FoC6LWE_1005918567) (Microsoft Virtual Academy, 3m00s).

## Profiling for IronPython

Because IronPython is not a CPython-based interpreter, the profiling feature above does not work.

Instead, use the Visual Studio .NET profiler by launching `ipy.exe` directly as the target application, using the appropriate arguments to launch your startup script. Include `-X:Debug` on the command line to ensure that all of your Python code can be debugged and profiled. This argument generates a performance report including time spent both in the IronPython runtime and you code. Your code is identified using mangled names.

Alternately, IronPython has some of its own built-in profiling but there's currently no good visualizer for it. See [An IronPython Profiler](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/curth/archive/2009/03/29/an-ironpython-profiler.aspx) (MSDN blogs) for what's available.
