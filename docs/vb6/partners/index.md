    <td><strong><a href="http://vbmigration.com">VB Migration Partner tool</a></strong></p>VB Migration Partner is an innovative VB6 conversion software, created by a team of renowned VB and .NET experts led by VB guru Francesco Balena, that helps you port VB6 applications to VB.NET or C#. It supports virtually all VB6 features and controls, and generates .NET applications with fewer errors and in less time than other conversion tools. VB Migration Partner relies on a sophisticated conversion engine that can handle constructs having no direct equivalent in the .NET Framework world. The code generation module and the powerful refactoring module emit .NET code that rivals in quality with code written by expert developers. Even better, developers can customize the generated code and can improve the behavior of the converted application while keeping it in sync with the original VB6 project, thanks to the Convert-Test-Fix cycle methodology.</td>
