# Troubleshoot Visual Studio development with Docker

When you're working with Visual Studio Container Tools, you may encounter issues while building or debugging your application. Below are some common troubleshooting steps.

## Volume sharing is not enabled. Enable volume sharing in the Docker CE for Windows settings  (Linux containers only)

To resolve this issue:

1. Right-click **Docker for Windows** in the notification area, and then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Shared Drives** and share the system drive along with the drive where the project resides.

> [!NOTE]
> If files appear shared, you may still need to click the "Reset credentials..." link at the bottom of the dialog in order to re-enable volume sharing. To continue after you reset credentials, you might have to restart Visual Studio.

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio versions later than Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 prompt when **Shared Drives** aren't configured.

### Container type

When adding Docker support to a project, you choose either a Windows or a Linux container. The Docker host must be running the same container type. To change the container type in the running Docker instance, right-click the System Tray's Docker icon and choose **Switch to Windows containers...** or **Switch to Linux containers...**.

## Unable to start debugging

One reason could be related to having stale debugging components in your user profile folder. Execute the following commands to remove these folders so that the latest debugging components are downloaded on the next debug session.

- del %userprofile%\vsdbg
- del %userprofile%\onecoremsvsmon

## Errors specific to networking when debugging your application

Try executing the script downloadable from [Cleanup Container Host Networking](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-server-container-tools/CleanupContainerHostNetworking),
which will refresh the network-related components on your host machine.

## Mounts denied

When using Docker for macOS, you might encounter an error referencing the folder /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder. Add the folder to the File Sharing tab in Docker
