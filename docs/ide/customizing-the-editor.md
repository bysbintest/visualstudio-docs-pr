# Customizing the editor

You can customize the formatting, tabs, fonts and colors, IntelliSense, and many other features of the Text Editor in general, or for a specific programming language. The topics in this section show you how to perform some of these customizations.

For more information about the Text Editor options, see [Text Editor Options dialog box](../ide/reference/text-editor-options-dialog-box.md).
