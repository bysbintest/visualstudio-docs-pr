# User Permissions and Visual Studio

For reasons of security you should run Visual Studio as a normal user whenever possible.

> [!WARNING]
> You should also make sure not to compile, launch, or debug any Visual Studio solution that does not come from a trusted person or a trusted location.

You can do nearly everything in the Visual Studio IDE as a normal user, but, you need administrator permissions to complete the following tasks:

## Running Visual Studio as an Administrator

You can launch Visual Studio with administrative permissions each time you start the IDE, or you can modify the application shortcut to always run with administrative permissions. For more information, see Windows Help.

### To run Visual Studio with administrative permissions

These instructions are for Windows 10. They are similar for other versions of Windows.

1. Open the **Start** menu, and scroll to Visual Studio 2017.

1. From the right-click or context menu of **Visual Studio 2017**, select **More** > **Run as administrator**.

     When Visual Studio starts, **(Administrator)** appears after the product name in the title bar.
