# Refactoring code

Refactoring is the process of modifying code in order to make it easier to maintain, understand, and extend, but without changing its behavior.

Different refactoring operations are available for different programming languages in Visual Studio. The topics in this section cover the refactorings available for C# and Visual Basic. For information about refactoring C++, code, see [Writing and refactoring code (C++)](/cpp/ide/writing-and-refactoring-code-cpp). Refactoring support for F# is provided by the [Visual F# Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FSharpSoftwareFoundation.VisualFPowerTools), a third-party Visual Studio extension.
