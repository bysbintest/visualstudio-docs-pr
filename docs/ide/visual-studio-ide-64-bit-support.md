# Visual Studio IDE 64-Bit Support

Visual Studio enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in Visual Studio, see [64-bit Applications](/dotnet/framework/64-bit-apps).

## Deploying a 64-bit application

[Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications](../deployment/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications.md) lists the redistributables you can use as prerequisites for the installation of a 64-bit application.

## Configuring projects as 64-bit applications

[How to: Configure Projects to Target Platforms](../ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-platforms.md) discusses configuring projects to be built as 64-bit applications.

## Debugging a 64-bit application
