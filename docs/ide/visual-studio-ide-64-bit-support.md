# Visual Studio IDE 64-Bit Support
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [64-bit Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/fd4026bc-2c3d-4b27-86dc-ec5e96018181).  
  
## Deploying a 64-bit application  
[Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications](../deployment/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications.md) lists the redistributables you can use as prerequisites for the installation of a 64-bit application.  
  
## Configuring projects as 64-bit applications  
[How to: Configure Projects to Target Platforms](../ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-platforms.md) discusses configuring projects to be built as 64-bit applications.  
  
## Debugging a 64-bit application  
 Edit and Continue does not work when [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../code-quality/includes/vsprvslong_md.md)] is running on a 64-bit Windows operating system. The following topics discuss debugging 64-bit applications.  
  
-   [Debug 64-Bit Applications](../debugger/debug-64-bit-applications.md)  
  
-   [Using Dump Files](../debugger/using-dump-files.md)
