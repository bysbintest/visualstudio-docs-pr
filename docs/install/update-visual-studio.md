# Update Visual Studio 2017 to the most recent release
We update Visual Studio often to extend its functionality and to fix customer-reported issues. To make sure you have the most [current, optimized release of Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#release-history), you'll want to update it. Here's how.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To install, update, or modify Visual Studio, you must log on with an account that has administrative permissions. For more information, see [User Permissions and Visual Studio](../ide/user-permissions-and-visual-studio.md).

## Update by using the Notifications hub
1. When there are updates, you will see a notification flag in Visual Studio.

  ![Update Visual Studio 2017 by using the Notification hub](media/notification-flag.png "The update Notification flag in Visual Studio")

  Choose the notification flag to open the **Notifications** hub.

2. Choose **"Visual Studio Update" is available**, which opens the **Extensions and Updates** dialog box.

3. In the **Extensions and Updates** dialog box, choose the **Update** button.

### More about Visual Studio notifications

Visual Studio notifies you when an update is available for Visual Studio itself or for any components, and also when certain events occur in the Visual Studio environment.

* When the notification flag is yellow, there is a Visual Studio product update available for you to install.
* When the notification flag is red, there is a problem with your license.
* When the notification flag is black, there are optional or informational messages to review.

Choose the notifications flag to open the **Notifications** hub and then choose the notifications that you want to act on. Or, choose to ignore or dismiss a notification.

If you choose to ignore a notification, Visual Studio will stop showing it. If you want to reset the list of ignored notifications, click the **Settings** button in the Notifications hub.

## Update by using the Visual Studio Installer
1.	Open the installer. You might need to update the installer before continuing. If this is the case, you'll be prompted to do so.
 >[!NOTE]
 > On a computer running Windows 10, you'll find the installer under the letter **V** as the **Visual Studio Installer**, or under the letter **M** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.

2.	On the **Product** page in the installer, look for the edition of Visual Studio that you have installed.

3.	If an update is available, you'll see an **Update** button. (It might take a few seconds for the installer to determine whether an update is available.)

  Choose the **Update** button to install the updates.
