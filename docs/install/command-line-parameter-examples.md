# Command-line parameter examples for Visual Studio 2017 installation
To illustrate how to [use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md),
here are several examples that you can customize to match your needs.

In each example, `vs_enterprise.exe`, `vs_professional.exe` and `vs_community.exe` represent the respective edition of the Visual Studio bootstrapper,
which is the small (approximately 1MB) file that initiates the download process. If you are using a different edition, substitute the appropriate bootstrapper name.

> [!NOTE]
> All commands require administrative elevation, and a User Account Control prompt will be displayed if the process is not started from an elevated prompt.

> [!NOTE]
>  You can use the `^` character at the end of a command line to concatenate multiple lines into a single command. Alternatively, you can simply place these lines together onto a single row. In PowerShell, the equivalent is the backtick (`` ` ``) character.

* Install a minimal instance of Visual Studio, with no interactive prompts but progress displayed:
```
vs_enterprise.exe --installPath C:\minVS ^
   --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor ^
   --passive --norestart
```

* Install a desktop instance of Visual Studio silently, with the French language pack, returning only when the product is installed.
```
vs_enterprise.exe --installPath C:\desktopVS ^
   --addProductLang fr-FR ^
   --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop ^
   --includeRecommended --quiet --wait
```

> [!NOTE]
>  The `--wait` parameter is designed for use in a batch file. In a batch file, execution of the next command will not continue until the installation has completed. The `%ERRORLEVEL%` environment variable will contain the return value of the command, as documented in the [Use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md) page.

* Download the Visual Studio core editor (the most minimal Visual Studio configuration). Only include the English language pack:

```cmd
vs_community.exe --layout C:\VS2017
   --lang en-US ^
   --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor
```

* Download the .NET desktop and .NET web workloads along with all recommended components and the GitHub extension. Only include the English language pack:
```
vs_community.exe --layout C:\VS2017 ^
   --lang en-US ^
   --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb ^
   --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop ^
   --add Component.GitHub.VisualStudio ^
   --includeRecommended
```

* Start an interactive installation of all workloads and components that are available in the Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise edition:
```
vs_enterprise.exe --all --includeRecommended --includeOptional
```

* Install a second, named instance of Visual Studio 2017 Professional on a machine with Visual Studio 2017 Community edition already installed, with support for Node.js development:
```
vs_professional.exe --installPath C:\VSforNode ^
   --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Node --includeRecommended --nickname VSforNode
```

* Remove the Profiling Tools component from the default installed Visual Studio instance:
```
vs_enterprise.exe modify ^
   --installPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise" ^
   --remove Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.DiagnosticTools ^
   --passive
```
