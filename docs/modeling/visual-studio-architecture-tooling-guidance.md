# Visual Studio Architecture Tooling Guidance
This Architecture Tooling Guidance is a downloadable package of practical guidance about the use of the modeling tools in Visual Studio 2010. It presents a high-level view of how to use all the modeling tools in an integrated manner, and discusses the most common scenarios in which the tools are used.
