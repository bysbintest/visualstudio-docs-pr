# Code analysis for managed code overview

Code analysis for managed code analyzes managed assemblies and reports information about the assemblies, such as violations of the programming and design rules set forth in the Microsoft .NET Framework Design Guidelines.

The analysis tool represents the checks it performs during an analysis as warning messages. Warning messages identify any relevant programming and design issues and, when it is possible, supply information about how to fix the problem.

## IDE (integrated development environment) integration

You can run code analysis on your project manually or automatically.

To run code analysis each time that you build a project, select **Enable Code Analysis on Build** on the project's Property Page. For more information, see [How to: Enable and Disable Automatic Code Analysis](../code-quality/how-to-enable-and-disable-automatic-code-analysis-for-managed-code.md).

To run code analysis manually on a project, from the menu bar choose **Analyze** > **Run Code Analysis** > **Run Code Analysis on <project>**. For more information, see [How to: Enable and Disable Automatic Code Analysis](../code-quality/how-to-enable-and-disable-automatic-code-analysis-for-managed-code.md).

## Rule sets

Code analysis rules for managed code are grouped into *rule sets*. You can use one of the Microsoft standard rule sets, or you can create a custom rule set to fulfill a specific need. For more information, see [Using Rule Sets to Group Code Analysis Rules](../code-quality/using-rule-sets-to-group-code-analysis-rules.md).

## Suppress warnings

Frequently, it is useful to indicate that a warning is non-applicable. This informs the developer, and other people who might review the code later, that a warning was investigated and then either suppressed or ignored.

In-source suppression of warnings is implemented through custom attributes. To suppress a warning, add the attribute `SuppressMessage` to the source code as shown in the following example:

```csharp
[System.Diagnosis.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Microsoft.Design", "CA1039:ListsAreStrongTyped")]
Public class MyClass
{
   // code
}
```

For more information, see [Suppress warnings](../code-quality/in-source-suppression-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you migrate a project to Visual Studio 2017, you might suddenly be faced with an overwhelming number of code analysis warnings. If you aren't ready to fix the warnings and want to temporarily turn code analysis off, open the project's property pages (**Project** > ***project* Properties...**) and go to the **Code Analysis** tab. Deselect **Enable Code Analysis on Build**, and then rebuild your project. Alternatively, you can select a different, smaller rule set to run against the code. Remember to turn code analysis back on when you are ready to fix the warnings.

## Run code analysis as part of check-in policy

As an organization, you might want to require that all check-ins satisfy certain policies. In particular, you want to make sure that you follow these policies:

- There are no build errors in code being checked in.

- Code analysis is run as part of the most recent build.

You can accomplish this by specifying check-in policies. For more information, see [Enhancing Code Quality with Team Project Check-in Policies](../code-quality/enhancing-code-quality-with-team-project-check-in-policies.md).

## Team build integration

You can use the integrated features of the build system to run the analysis tool as part of the build process. For more information, see [Build and release (VSTS)](/vsts/build-release/index).
