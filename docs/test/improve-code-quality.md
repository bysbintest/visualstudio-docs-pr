# Testing tools in Visual Studio

Visual Studio testing tools can help you and your team to develop and sustain high standards of code excellence.

> [!NOTE]
> Unit testing is availble in all editions of Visual Studio. Other testing tools, such as live unit testing, IntelliTest, and Coded UI tests are only available in Visual Studio Enterprise edition. For more information about editions see [Compare Visual Studio 2017 IDEs](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/compare/).
