# Unit Test Your Code
Unit tests give developers and testers a quick way to look for logic errors in the methods of classes in [!INCLUDE[csharp_current_short](../misc/includes/csharp_current_short_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vb_current_short](../debugger/includes/vb_current_short_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_short](../misc/includes/cpp_current_short_md.md)] projects.  
  
 The unit test tools include:  
  
1.  **Test Explorer.** Test Explorer lets you run unit tests and view their results. Test Explorer can use any unit test framework, including a third-party framework, that has an adapter for the Explorer.  
  
2.  **Microsoft unit test framework for managed code.** The Microsoft unit test framework for managed code is installed with Visual Studio and provides a framework for testing .NET code.  
  
3.  **Microsoft unit test framework for C++.** The Microsoft unit test framework for C++ is installed with Visual Studio and provides a framework for testing native code.  Google Test, Boost.Test, and CTest frameworks are also included with Visual Studio and third-party adapters are available for additional test frameworks. For more information, see [Writing Unit Tests for C/C++](writing-unit-tests-for-c-cpp.md). 
  
4.  **Code coverage tools.** You can determine the amount of product code that your unit tests exercise from one command in Test Explorer.  
  
5.  **Microsoft Fakes isolation framework.** The Microsoft Fakes isolation framework can create substitute classes and methods for production and system code that create dependencies in the code under test. By implementing the fake delegates for a function, you control the behavior and output of the dependency object.  
  
 You can also use [IntelliTest](../test/generate-unit-tests-for-your-code-with-intellitest.md) to explore your .NET code to generate test data and a suite of unit tests. For every statement in the code, a test input is generated that will execute that statement. A case analysis is performed for every conditional branch in the code.  
  
## Key tasks  
 Use the following topics to help with understanding and creating unit tests:  
  
|Tasks|Associated Topics|  
|-----------|-----------------------|  
|**Quick starts and walkthroughs:** Use the following topics to learn unit testing in Visual Studio from code examples.|-   [Walkthrough: Creating and Running Unit Tests for Managed Code](../test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code.md)<br />-   [Quick Start: Test Driven Development with Test Explorer](../test/quick-start-test-driven-development-with-test-explorer.md)<br />-   [Adding unit tests to existing C++ applications](../test/unit-testing-existing-cpp-applications-with-test-explorer.md)|  
|**Unit testing with Test Explorer:** Learn how Test Explorer can help create more productive and efficient unit tests.|-   [Unit Test Basics](../test/unit-test-basics.md)<br />-   [Create a unit test project](../test/create-a-unit-test-project.md)<br />-   [Run unit tests with Test Explorer](../test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer.md)<br />-   [Install third-party unit test frameworks](../test/install-third-party-unit-test-frameworks.md)<br />-   [Upgrading Coded UI test from Visual Studio 2010](../test/upgrading-coded-ui-tests-from-visual-studio-2010.md)|  
|**Unit testing managed code:**|-   [Writing Unit Tests for the .NET Framework with the Microsoft Unit Test Framework for Managed Code](../test/writing-unit-tests-for-the-dotnet-framework-with-the-microsoft-unit-test-framework-for-managed-code.md)|  
|**Unit testing C++ code**|-   [Writing Unit tests for C/C++ with the Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++](../test/writing-unit-tests-for-c-cpp-with-the-microsoft-unit-testing-framework-for-cpp.md)|  
|**Isolating unit tests**|-   [Isolating Code Under Test with Microsoft Fakes](../test/isolating-code-under-test-with-microsoft-fakes.md)|  
|**Use code coverage to identify what proportion of your project's code is being tested using unit tests:** Learn about the code coverage feature of [!INCLUDE[vsprvsts](../code-quality/includes/vsprvsts_md.md)] testing tools.|-   [Using Code Coverage to Determine How Much Code is being Tested](../test/using-code-coverage-to-determine-how-much-code-is-being-tested.md)|  
|**Perform stress and performance analysis by using load tests for your unit tests:** You can create a load test and add your unit tests to it to help isolate performance and stress issues in your application.|-   [Load Testing (VSTS and TFS)](/vsts/load-test/)|  
|**Set and enforce quality gates:** You can create quality gates to enforce that tests are run before code is checked in, to help ensure the quality of the code.|-   [Set and Enforce Quality Gates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bdc5666e-6cf0-45b2-a0a1-133c3f61e852)|  
|**Extend the unit test type:** You can add functionality to your tests that might not be in the Unit Test Framework. For example, you can add a test property that specifies if a test should run as a normal user or not. Or you can extend the framework to add row attributes to a method and use the data in that row inside the test.|For sample code of how to extend the unit test framework, see the following [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=185591).|  
|**Set testing options:** For example, you can specify where test results are stored.|[Configure unit tests by using a .runsettings file](../test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file.md)|  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting>  
 Describes the UnitTesting namespace, which provides attributes, exceptions, asserts, and other classes that support unit testing.  
  
 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.Web>  
 Describes the UnitTesting.Web namespace, which extends the UnitTesting namespace by providing support for [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] and Web service unit tests.
