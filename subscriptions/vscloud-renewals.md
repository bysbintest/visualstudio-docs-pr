# Buying Visual Studio Cloud Subscriptions - Renewals

Renewing your cloud subscriptions happens automatically, and renewal charges will appear on your Azure bill.  Below are some examples of what to expect.
## Monthly Subscriptions
Microsoft will prorate your first month.  

**Example:**  If you were to purchase on the 15th, you should expect your first bill to be charged at roughly 50%.  Then, each subsequent month will always be billed at full price on the 1st of each month.

## Annual Subscriptions
Annual subscriptions renew on the 1st of the month following the anniversary of your purchase date.  After the first renewal, the renewal date will stay consistent.

**Example:**  A subscription purchased on January 15, 2018 has a renewal date of February 1, 2019.

## FAQ:
### Q:  What if I donâ€™t want to auto-renew?
A:  To avoid renewal charges, you will need to cancel your Visual Studio cloud subscription prior to the auto-renewal date.  If you decide to cancel your subscription, you may still access your benefits for the remaining duration of the subscription.
