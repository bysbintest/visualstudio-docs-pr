# Buying Visual Studio Cloud Subscriptions - Overview

With our cloud subscriptions, you can rent Visual Studio, VSTS, and the subscriber benefits you need without a long-term contract. Billing is handled through your Microsoft Azure subscription, supporting credit card payment, purchases through the Enterprise Agreement contract*, and [Cloud Solution Provider](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/search) partners. If you don’t have an Azure subscription yet, no worries—it’s free to set up and you can do this while you make your first purchase.
