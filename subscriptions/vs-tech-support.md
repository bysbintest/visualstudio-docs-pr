# Activating the Technical Support Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Resolve break-fix issues in non-production environments.  (Note:  Benefit must by activated before you can submit a support request.)  Visual Studio Enterprise standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive four incidents, while Visual Studio Professional standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive two incidents.  

**NOTE:**  Not all subscriptions at a given level are eligible to receive support incidents.  Subscriptions acquired through FTE, NFR, MPN, MCT and other programs do not receive support incidents.  If your subscription is not eligible to receive technical support incidents, the Technical Support tile will not appear in your available benefits. 

   ![Technical Support Benefit Tile](_img\vs-tech-support\vs-tech-support-tile.png)

1.	To begin using your Technical Support benefit, click on **Activate** on the Technical Support tile. 

2.	This will initiate a chat session with a representative who can create your Contract ID and Access ID and provide those to you. 

3.  To complete the process, you will need to provide the representative with:
    - The email address you use to sign in to your subscription
    - The Subscription ID which can be found on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) tab.

**NOTE:** To activate your support account in a language other than English, choose your country from [this list](http://support.microsoft.com/activatesupport).   

# How to submit an incident
Once you have your Contract ID and Access ID set up, when you need support you can call the  technical support number for your country, submit a support incident [online](http://support.microsoft.com/oas/), or submit an incident via the Azure portal.  If would prefer to receive support over the phone, you can still submit your incident online, and a Microsoft Support Professional will call you back.

## Submitting an incident online
1.  To [submit an incident online](http://support.microsoft.com/oas/), specify the product you need help with.  You can either select from the various lists, or search for it by name.  To submit an incident for Visual Studio Enterprise 2017, for example, click on **Visual Studio** in the **Developer Tools** group.
