# Buying Visual Studio Cloud Subscriptions - Making Your First Purchase

Purchasing a Visual Studio cloud subscription is simple.  Check out the steps below for a quick overview.

1.	Visit https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions and sign in.

2.	Select the monthly or annual subscription you wish to purchase.

3.	From the subscription overview page, click **Get**.

4.	You'll be redirected to the start of the purchase process, and the system will search for your Azure subscription
    -  If an Azure subscription is not found, you can create a [Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) by clicking **Create a new Azure Subscription**.

    **Note:**  This process will require a credit card, unless previously approved for invoice
    -  If you expected the search to find an Azure subscription and none was found, please check the account you used to sign in.  If you have multiple accounts, try signing in with another account and starting again at step 1 above.  

5.	Once the Azure subscription is identified, you will see its name in the drop down.   At this point you have completed the billing requirements and can click **Continue**.

6.	Select the quantity of subscriptions you wish to purchase.

7.	Review you order, click **Confirm**, and youâ€™re done!

Next Step:  Check out our [documentation](/visualstudio/subscriptions/) to learn more about assigning and managing subscriptions.
