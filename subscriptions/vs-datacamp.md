# Activating the DataCamp Training Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Eligible Visual Studio subscriptions include subscriptions to DataCamp.  With DataCamp, you can learn all the data science skills you need from the comfort of your browser. You get to choose when and what you learn. With no software to install and no special hardware requirements, learning data science is easier than ever.

The duration of your DataCamp benefit depends upon your Visual Studio subscription:
