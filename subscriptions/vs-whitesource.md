4.	In the **Activate your account** section of the page, you’ll be guided through four steps:
    - [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whitesource.ws-bolt) the WhiteSource Bolt extension from Microsoft Visual Studio marketplace. If you don’t have permissions to install extensions, please visit [this page](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/marketplace/get-vsts-extensions#request).

    Click the green **Install** button if you are using VSTS, or the **Download** button for Team Foundation Server.  For this example, we will use VSTS. 

    ![WhiteSource Benefit Install Extension](_img\vs-whitesource\vs-whitesource-download-install.png)

    - Next, select the VSTS account you want to use and click **Confirm**.  (If you have not yet set up VSTS, visit the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) page and activate your VSTS benefit.)

    ![WhiteSource Benefit Confirm Account](_img\vs-whitesource\vs-whitesource-confirm-account.png)

    - You’ll receive a confirmation that the extension is installed and ready to use.  Click **Get started** to return to the WhiteSource Bolt page and continue.

5.  Open your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) project dashboard, click on the **Build & Release** menu and choose **WhiteSource Bolt**.

    ![WhiteSource Benefit Add Extension](_img\vs-whitesource\vs-whitesource-installed-cropped.png)

6. Paste the activation code from the WhiteSource Bolt benefit tile and click **Activate**. Each of your activation codes can be used to activate only one project. 

    ![WhiteSource Benefit Activate Code](_img\vs-whitesource\vs-whitesource-activate-code-cropped.png)

7.  Your activation is now complete, and you will have 180 days remaining on your subscription. 

8.  You’ll need to add the WhiteSource Bolt extension as one of your build steps.  A video is available on the [WhiteSource Bolt page](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/whitesource_bolt_visualstudio_2017/#activate) to show you how.  

9. Once you’ve run your build, the following comprehensive reports and dashboards will be generated automatically:
    - Security vulnerabilities dashboard
    - Security vulnerabilities report
    - Outdated libraries report
    - License risks and compliance dashboard
    - Inventory report
