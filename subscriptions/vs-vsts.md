# Activating the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Benefit in Visual Studio Subscriptions

When you sign in to VSTS using the same identity that you used for activating your Visual Studio subscription, we recognize this automatically. This works for both the primary identity that you use when you log in to the Subscriber Portal and any alternate identity you've configured for your Visual Studio subscription. VSTS supports both Microsoft accounts (like @outlook.com) and work or school accounts (which use an Azure Active Directory managed by your organization). You can use both your primary and alternate identities in VSTS, and can join any number of VSTS accounts as a member.

# VSTS Features Included by Visual Studio Subscription Level

These VSTS features are included in the following subscriptions:

# Create Your VSTS Account

To use VSTS, youâ€™ll need to create an account, or to be added as a member in an account that someone else owns. Creating a VSTS account is free, and you can create multiple VSTS accounts.
