Not sure which subscription you're using?  Connect to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) to see all the subscriptions assigned to your email address. If you don't see all your subscriptions, you may have one or more assigned to a different email address.  You'll need to sign in with that email address to see those subscriptions. 

When you sign in to VSTS using the same identity that you used for activating your Visual Studio subscription, we recognize this automatically. This works for both the primary identity that you use when you log in to the Subscriber Portal and any alternate identity you've configured for your Visual Studio subscription. VSTS supports both Microsoft accounts (like @outlook.com) and work or school accounts (which use an Azure Active Directory managed by your organization). You can use both your primary and alternate identities in VSTS, and can join any number of VSTS accounts as a member.

To use VSTS, you’ll need an account. You can sign in with an existing account, or create a new one.  To create a new account:
1.	Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2.  Locate the Visual Studio Team Services tile in the Tools section, and click the “Get Started” link at the bottom of the benefit tile.   

These VSTS features are included in the following subscriptions: 
- Visual Studio Enterprise: [Basic](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/), [Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web), [Package Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed)
- Visual Studio Professional: [Basic](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/)
- MSDN Platforms: [Basic](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/), [Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web)
- Visual Studio Test Professional: [Basic](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/), [Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web)

3.	Enter a name for your VSTS project site.  

4.  Choose whether you want to use **Git** or **Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)** to manage your project.  This is a permanent choice for each team project you create, but you can use both TFVC and Git team projects in the same team project collection.  Not sure which to use? 
    - Git:  Git is a decentralized version control system. Each developer has a copy of the entire source repository on their dev machine. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dev machine and perform version control operations such as history and compare without a network connection.  [Learn more](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/git/gitquickstart) about Git.
    - TFVC: Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) is a centralized version control system. Typically, Team members have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Historical data is maintained only on the server. Branches are path-based and created on the server. [Learn more](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/tfvc/overview) about Team Foundation Version Control.

 
5.  Click **Change details** to customize options for Project name, how you organize your work (Agile, Scrum, CMMI), where to host your projects, and how to share your work with others.  Click “Continue”.

# Create Your VSTS Account
