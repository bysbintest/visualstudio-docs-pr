## Frequently asked questions
### Q:  What topics are covered in the classes and lectures?
A:  You'll find a complete list of courses and lectures for both offers at:  https://www.xamarin.com/university/mobile-training 

### Q: I’m already a Xamarin University subscriber. Does this affect my Xamarin University Mobile Training benefit?
A:  No, existing Xamarin University subscribers will have full access to their Xamarin University annual subscription, including live courses, materials, and guest lectures by logging-in at university.xamarin.com.  
Courses included as a benefit in Visual Studio Dev Essentials program and Visual Studio Subscriptions are separate from your Xamarin University subscription and accessed from your Visual Studio Dev Essentials or Visual Studio portal, not university.xamarin.com.  While the Xamarin University Mobile Training course recordings included in Visual Studio Dev Essentials program and Visual Studio subscriptions are included with your annual Xamarin University subscription, they remain available as long as the program membership or Visual Studio subscription are valid. You will continue to access from your Visual Studio Dev Essentials or Visual Studio portal, independent of your Xamarin University subscription status.

### Q:  Can I become a Certified Xamarin Developer with the Xamarin University included in Visual Studio Dev Essentials? What about through Visual Studio subscriptions?
A:  No, courses and materials included with Xamarin University in both Visual Studio Dev Essentials and Visual Studio/MSDN Subscriptions are not valid for certification. Materials, courses and recordings needed to earn Xamarin Certification are only included in the full Xamarin University subscription.
