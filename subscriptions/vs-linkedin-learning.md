# Activating the LinkedIn Learning Benefit in Your Visual Studio Subscription

Unlock the power of LinkedIn with access to the people, insights, and skills you need to advance your career.  Learn the most in-demand business, tech and creative skills from industry experts.

Your Visual Studio subscription includes a subscription to LinkedIn Premium, which includes LinkedIn Learning.  The length of your Premium subscription depends on the type of Visual Studio subscription you have:

| Subscription                                                     | Benefit                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Visual Studio Enterprise standard & annual cloud subscriptions   | 6 month Premium subscription |
| Visual Studio Professional standard & annual cloud subscriptions | 3 month Premium subscription |
| Visual Studio Test Professional                                  | 3 month Premium subscription |
| MSDN Platforms                                                   | 3 month Premium subscription |
| Visual Studio Dev Essentials                                     | 3 month Premium subscription | 

You will need to have a LinkedIn account to take advantage of your LinkedIn Learning benefit.  If you don't have one already, you'll have a chance to create one before you activate your Premium subscription.  

To activate your Premium subscription and LinkedIn Learning benefit:
1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).

2. Locate the LinkedIn Learning tile in the Education category, and click the **Get code** link.
