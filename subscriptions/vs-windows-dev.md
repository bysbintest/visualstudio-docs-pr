Not sure which subscription you're using?  Connect to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) to see all the subscriptions assigned to your email address. If you don't see all your subscriptions, you may have one or more assigned to a different email address.  You'll need to sign in with that email address to see those subscriptions. 

## Activation Steps

To use your Windows Developer Account, you’ll need to set up an account or sign in using an existing account.

We recommend that you create a "private" browser window for this process.  For example, in Google Chrome, create a new "incongnito" window.  In Internet Explorer, create a new "InPRivate" window.

1.	Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2.  Locate the Windows Developer Account tile in the Tools section and click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.  Copy the code to your clipboard, then click **Activate**.

4.	On the next page, select the country or region where you live or where your business is located, and then click **Next**. 
5.	Select **Individual** as your account type.  
6.	Create your publisher display name.  This will be the unique name your customers will see associated with your apps, add-ins, and services. 
7.	Provide your contact information and preferred email language, then click **Next**.
8.	You may be asked to verify your password.  Enter it and click **Sign in**.
