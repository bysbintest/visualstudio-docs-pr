# Locating Your Subscription ID for Visual Studio Subscriptions

## What is a subscription ID?
The "Subscription ID" is a 32-digit GUID associated with a subscriber's subscription or program.  In some situations, the Support team may ask a subscriber to provide their subscriber ID to narrow down potential issues with a specific subscription. 

## How to find your subscription ID
1. Go to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Sign in to your subscription.  (Get help [signing in](/visualstudio/subscriptions/signing-in).)
3. Once you've signed in, you will see a list of the subscriptions associated with the email address you used to sign in.  You can see:
    - Subscription/Program type
    - Subscription ID 
    - Type (Retail, NFR, etc)
    - Valid Through date.  (Expiration)
    - Links to renew, obtain support information, and in the case of Visual Studio Dev Essentials, to leave the program.
